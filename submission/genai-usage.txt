"Give me a barebones HTML structure for my personal website without adding any additional sections"

Here’s as barebones as it gets—just the essential HTML skeleton, no extra sections, no fluff:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
If you want, I can strip it down even further (or add exactly one thing, like a linked CSS file, and nothing else).
